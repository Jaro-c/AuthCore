	// authenticated data and the blind index, so a caller who does not
	// name the field is telling the module nothing, and silently
	// accepting "" would make every field share one keyspace.
	//
	// Safety: INTERNAL — a startup/programming error. Treat as a 500.

	// input shorter than the nonce, an input that is not valid base64,
	// and a failed GCM authentication tag. The three are not
	// distinguished, because which one failed is information about the
	// stored data and the caller has nothing useful to do differently.
	// A row that does not decrypt is corrupt or never belonged to this
	// column, and the response is the same either way.
	//
	// Safety: CLIENT-SAFE — the caller may surface a generic error
	// ("could not read this row") to the user. Do not echo the input
	// back, and do not log enough to recreate the ciphertext.
