	// valid base32 (with or without padding). The caller should treat this

	// shape but does not match".

	// replay was attempted; the caller should treat it as a security event
	// and revoke the user's second factor.
	//
	// Safety: CLIENT-SAFE — the caller chooses the response. The user-visible
	// message is normally the same as ErrInvalidCode to avoid telling an
	// attacker the code was once valid, but the caller MUST log this case
	// distinctly because it is the signal that a stolen code was tried.
