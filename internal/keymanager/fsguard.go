// This file holds the filesystem rules the key directory is written under.
// There are two of them and they deliberately point in opposite directions.
//
// Writes refuse to follow a symlink. Nothing legitimate creates a managed key
// file through a link, and following one hands an attacker who can write into
// KeysDir before authcore first runs a choice of where the freshly generated
// private key lands. That is not exotic for this library: a mounted container
// volume, a provisioning script, a restored backup or a Compose file can all
// populate the directory first.
//
// Reads keep following symlinks, and that is not an oversight. The documented
// Kubernetes deployment mounts a Secret at KeysDir, and Kubernetes projects a
// Secret volume as a tree of symlinks, so a loader that refused links would
// break every replica following the deployment guide in docs/key-management.md.
// Read-following is also the weaker exposure: the read path already caps the
// file at 4 KiB and validates the key pair, and a caller who can redirect a
// read can equally replace the file itself.

// fileState is what a presence check can conclude about a managed filename.

// rather than assumed: a dangling link classified as absent sends the caller
// down the generate path and into createExclusive, which refuses it and says
// so, naming the link and what to do about it. Classifying it as present here
// instead makes the consistency check fire first, and that error tells the
// operator to "delete all key files", which since auth/field shipped is the
// advice that destroys every encrypted column. The worse message is not worth
// a control that O_EXCL already provides.

// ones included, so the write cannot be redirected out of the key directory.
// O_NOFOLLOW would state the property more loudly but lives in syscall rather
// than os and is not defined on Windows, and this library ships to Windows
// consumers, so the portable flag that already has the property is the one to
// rely on.
//
// It also closes the narrower race the exclusion used to leave open: a regular
// file appearing between the presence check and the write kept its own
// permissions, so a 0644 file planted at that moment received the private key.
// Creation now fails instead.
