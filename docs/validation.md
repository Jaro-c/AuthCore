# Email & username validation

`auth/email` and `auth/username` validate and normalize user input into a
canonical form before you store it. See the [error reference](errors.md) and the
runnable [email](../examples/email/) and [username](../examples/username/)
examples.

## Email

### Setup

```go
emailMod, err := email.New(auth)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
// Close is an optional no-op kept for backward compatibility — the module runs
// no background goroutine, so no cleanup is required.
```

### Validating and normalizing

Always call `ValidateAndNormalize` instead of validating and normalizing
separately. It lowercases, trims whitespace, and validates in a single call —
ensuring the value you store is always in canonical form:

```go
normalized, err := emailMod.ValidateAndNormalize(req.Email)
switch {
case errors.Is(err, email.ErrInvalidEmail):
    // 400 — tell the user exactly what failed (message is descriptive)
    c.JSON(400, map[string]string{"error": errors.Unwrap(err).Error()})
    return
case err != nil:
    // 500 — unexpected error
}
// Store normalized — always lowercase, trimmed.
db.StoreUser(normalized, ...)
```

Validation rules (RFC 5321 / RFC 5322):

| Rule | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Total length | 1 – 254 characters |
| Format | One `@` separating a non-empty local part and domain |
| Local part | ≤ 64 characters |
| Domain | At least one dot; no leading, trailing, or consecutive dots |
| Domain labels | 1 – 63 characters each |

> **Always normalize before storing and before querying.** This ensures
> consistent lookup — `User@EXAMPLE.COM` and `user@example.com` are the same
> address.

### Plus-addressing

Plus-addressing (`user+tag@example.com`) is accepted by default: this is an
[open policy field](configuration.md#the-principle). A deployment that
treats `(local, domain)` as the unique account key and wants one mailbox to
be unable to own N accounts can refuse plus-addressing:

```go
emailMod, err := email.NewWithConfig(auth, email.Config{
    RejectPlusAddressing: true,
})
// user+tag@example.com is now rejected with the reason "plus-addressing
// is not allowed".
```

The structural validation (RFC 5321/5322, IDN punycode, domain rules) is
unaffected.

> [!NOTE]
> **Internationalised domains (IDN)** are supported. Unicode domains are
> converted to ASCII punycode during normalisation:
>
> ```
> user@münchen.de  →  user@xn--mnchen-3ya.de
> user@例え.jp     →  user@xn--r8jz45g.jp
> ```
>
> Store the ASCII form so DNS lookups and database comparisons are deterministic.

### Verifying a domain can receive email

`VerifyDomain` performs an optional DNS MX lookup to confirm the domain is
configured to receive email. Call it after `ValidateAndNormalize` when you want
to reject obviously fake domains before sending a verification email.

Results are cached per domain (default 5 minutes) and DNS lookups for the same
domain are deduplicated via `singleflight` — safe for high-concurrency workloads.

```go
ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(r.Context(), 3*time.Second)
defer cancel()

err = emailMod.VerifyDomain(ctx, normalized)
switch {
case errors.Is(err, email.ErrDomainNoMX):
    // 400 — domain exists but cannot receive email
    c.JSON(400, map[string]string{"error": "email domain cannot receive messages"})
    return
case errors.Is(err, email.ErrDomainUnresolvable):
    // DNS lookup failed — do NOT block the user; log and continue
    log.Warn("DNS check unavailable: %v", err)
}
```

> **`ErrDomainUnresolvable` is a soft failure.** DNS can be temporarily
> unavailable due to network issues unrelated to the user's input. Never block a
> registration on this error — log it and proceed.

## Username

### Setup

```go
userMod, err := username.New(auth)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
```

### Validating and normalizing

Always call `ValidateAndNormalize` — it lowercases, trims whitespace, and
validates in a single call, ensuring the value you store is always in canonical
form:

```go
normalized, err := userMod.ValidateAndNormalize(req.Username)
if err != nil {
    // errors.Unwrap(err).Error() contains the specific rule that failed.
    c.JSON(400, map[string]string{"error": errors.Unwrap(err).Error()})
    return
}
db.StoreUser(normalized, ...) // always lowercase, trimmed, validated
```

Validation rules:

| Rule | Default |
|---|---|
| Length | `MinLength` – `MaxLength` (default 3 – 32 characters) |
| Allowed characters | `[a-z0-9_-]` only (closed - the homoglyph control) |
| First character | Letter or digit (not `_` or `-`) |
| Last character | Letter or digit (not `_` or `-`) |
| Consecutive specials | `__`, `--`, `_-`, `-_` are rejected |
| Reserved names | Built-in blocklist, extended with `Config.ExtraReservedNames` and trimmed with `Config.AllowReservedNames` |

The length bounds and the reserved-names list are
[configurable policy fields](configuration.md#the-principle). The
character set, normalisation, and consecutive-specials rule stay closed - 
widening the character set to Unicode is exactly what enables
homoglyph impersonation, and is the part of the module that *is* a
security standard rather than a product default.

> **Always normalize before storing and before querying.** `Alice123` and
> `alice123` are the same username — store only the canonical (normalized) form.
